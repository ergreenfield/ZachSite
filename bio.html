<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Zachary Krieger is a resourceful and passionate voice teacher with a deep appreciation for a wide range of vocal repertoire. His teaching philosophy focuses on addressing the needs of the individual. Variety is something that makes us all unique and beautiful; because of the innate diversity among individuals, Zachary has learned to hone his skills as a pedagogue via constant flexibility and empathy. </p>
<p>As a performer, Zachary is drawn to the finesse and complexities of German, French and American art song. A great proponent of new works, his most recent recitals have largely featured 20th and 21st century cabaret and art song, including the songs of Williams Bolcom, John Musto, and Stephen Sondheim. </p>
    <p>Zachary earned his Master of Music Degree in Vocal Pedagogy & Performance from Westminster Choir College and his Bachelor of Music Degree in Voice from Central Michigan University. While at Westminster, he enjoyed singing with the world-renowned Westminster Symphonic Choir and remains inspired by some of those performances; his favorites include Brahms’ <i>Ein Deutsches Requiem</i> with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Maestro Yannick Nézet-Séguin, as well as Handel’s <i>Messiah</i> with The New York Philharmonic conducted by Peter Schreier. Some of his other stage credits include Bach’s <i>St. John Passion</i> (Bass soloist, Jesus, and chorus), Bach’s <i>Christ lag in Todesbanden</i> (Bass soloist and chorus), and Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i> (Leporello). One of Zachary’s most memorable performances was the premiere of Philip Rice’s <i><a href="http://philiprice.net/genres/chamber/sleepers.html" target="_blank" class="sleepers">The Sleepers</a></i> for vocal quartet, piano and handbell choir. </p>
<p>While studying voice at Central Michigan University, he maintained and cultivated his piano skills accompanying singers and instrumentalists. It was there that he realized his interest in teaching private music lessons. The connection established between teacher and student in a private setting is vital to the growth of a musician. Not only does this connection result in superior music-making, but it yields a more sincere and open-hearted individual. Whether on the stage or in the studio, communication and connection remain central to musical integrity and personal growth.
