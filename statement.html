<h2 class="Philosophy">Philosophy of Teaching Voice</h2>
<p>As a teacher of voice, I firmly base my philosophy on teaching the individual, adapting as is necessary to consider the personal needs of the student.  More than simply instructing a student in notes and rhythms, as a teacher I consider it a priority to create a foundation from which an individual can find meaning.  With this I could provide the individual with the opportunity to discover a better mode of communication. In order to communicate effectively, I need to supply the student with the appropriate tools</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sense of meaningful communication usually isn’t achieved within the first few lessons.  This is the ultimate goal and is more easily reached after a few tools have been well established.  I ascribe to Dr. Christopher Arneson’s flow chart of vocal events: </p>
<ol class="pedlist">
    <li>Relaxation — this allows for a neutral body and helps to remove any emotional/physical blockage.</li> 
    <li>Posture and Alignment — after a relaxed body is achieved, a healthy singer’s posture will better allow for the student to accomplish the next steps.</li> 
    <li>Breathing and laryngeal positioning — after a healthy posture, the student is better equipped for a natural and exhilarated inhalation.  Attached to the open breath is the low and comfortable positioning of the larynx and the lofty high positioning of the velum. </li> 
    <li>Phonation — this follows the breath and requires the next three steps to be effective.</li>
    <li>Support — this is best understood with the description of the <i>appoggio</i>.  This idea needs to be paired with textual intention and the maintenance of an open body.</li> 
    <li>Registration — building the register events can be taught through a variety of means.  Depending on the student, these means could include a description of sound quality (i.e. "hooty" versus "brassy"), kinesthetic awareness/understanding, or through an emotional context (i.e. "angry" versus "sad").</li>
    <li>Resonance — this usually comes as a result of the steps above.</li>
    <li>Articulation—free of restriction allowing for legato vocal line and effective communication.</li>
    </ol>

<p>These steps have been assembled considering the general student.  Since we don’t teach a generic student, the steps will most likely need to be rearranged to encompass the needs of the individual. Throughout the process described above, I consider it important to encourage an emotional undercurrent to consistently be present.  Imagery is a valuable tool which can be used to influence vocal production; but depending on the student’s learning style, the use of imagery needs to be closely monitored and balanced with scientific fact.  </p>  
<p>Despite learning style, an emotional concentration is necessary in developing a sincere and open-hearted student.  Only through an open heart can a genuine performance be given.  It is my duty to enable personal and emotional growth in a student, reminding him/her of the importance of communication and emotional connection.  Our need for connection and communication stems from our need for life—when we cease to grow and connect we cease to live. </p>
